Knowledge Aggregator
--------------------

We have Twitter for trivial conversations like:
I like coffe. There's free coffee at #rubyfuza.

We have Facebook for:
Last year I liked coffee. This year I like tea.

We have G+ (Basically, facebook for people who can figure out how to use Google products), for:
If you drink coffee, your blood pressure will rise. Why? Because... er... read here.

BUT Wheres our knowledge aggregator?
Why can't you fork the comments on your posts off into separate trees:

Yes/No comments

Built-on comments

Builds-on comments

...Or linked into a more diverse knowledge tree, ala the one Khan Academy used to track class progress in their school trials?

Why not:
Make it easy to aggregate knowledge - so that
 - People don't have to figure out 1 000 000 000 times over what the best metaphor is to explain a topic
 - for a certain aptitude / personality type / education level
 - Have to wonder about the same things in independence...
 
Anyways, version one is to be a series of simple "dashboard" like views for perhaps G+, Twitter and Facebook, plus all your bookmarks/faves/internet history that pulls your whole stream into a database, aggregates it into a page much like you see on "Twazzup" - but allows your friends to tag, link or fork COMMENTS on topics.

Contribute! Lets accelerate knowledge acquisition by lowering the barrier to discussion and constructive sharing!
